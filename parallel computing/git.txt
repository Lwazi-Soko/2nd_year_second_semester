    I  finished benchmarking here moved to the library pc ,using it as my local machine from what i have observed ,which was not what i expected this remote server oudid the library PC time and time again i ran many experiments and in all of them the remote server attained a higher speedup

    I just found the optimum density to be 0.1 ,which I aim to use for benchmarking, also in this process i have created a bash script to help autmate the iterative process

    I just started checking if the parallel version of the program is valid ,I used the the inputs (100 0.2 56) and (100 0.2 34) and for both i got the same maximum mana and the same boss co-ordinates now I a yet to check if the images from the serial and parallel versions are identical using the compare command in cloudshell

    I transfered my new parallel dungeon program , unlike the previous version which i deleted this one initialises the hunting tasks in the main class and implements the recursive task in the main class , while the former version implemented this in the huntParalell class and it also only initialised the hunt after having reached the cutoff threshold which ran and found the right co-ordinated but the output images did not match the serial version

    I just created a working version of the parallel vesion ,it outputs the exact picture as the serial version , i am yet transfare it into nighmare

    I just did another test onmy parallel version and this time i was tewsting if it got any faster with an imbalanced load and from visual inspection i can say it seems to bester becasue I tailored it to have the fork() part handle the heavier side of the workload in the events of an odd number of searches

     I just did a a lot of manual testing and kept on increasing the no. of searches until we got to twenty million searches and then the parallel version started to loose by a large margin , also the optimal cutoff threshold seemed to be 2000 searches

    I changed the distribution of the number of searches between the left and right subdivisions in my for and join algorithm to account for cases where the number of searches is as i intend to test such a case to see if this has any significance

    I just uploaded my parallel program to nightmare, it awaits modifications
