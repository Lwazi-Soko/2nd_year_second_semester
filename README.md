# 2nd_year_second_semester
Has my second semester work in compsci
## parallel computing folder  
**Has my main parallel computing program:**  

*Imangine youre Sung Jin Wo in Solo levelling the program simulates initiating your shadows **concurrently** to search uphill looking for the highest/strongest mana(looking for the dungeon boss for my fellow anime watchers) within a dungeon map*
*Note to run program use **java DungeonHunterParallel 100 0.4 0.3** where **argument1 is for the gate size, argument2 is for the number of seachers and argument3 is a seed creating a different map each time you change use or you can make it to be 0 for randmoness**
